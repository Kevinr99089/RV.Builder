# <p align="center"> What is ReVanced ?

RV, for **R**e**V**anced, like **RVX**, for **R**e**V**anced e**X**tended, are modified applications of YT and YT Music  that lets you add many functions not present natively, such as Sponsorblock (which lets you add a function to skip parts of a video like sponsors, intros, outros and many others) or Return YT Dislikes (which lets you restore the Dislikes counter on videos, useful for quickly checking whether a video is worth watching or not). and other functions that let you hide ads, hide shorts, hide the create button, change the home page when the app starts and much more, all of which can be enabled or disabled, so you can choose what you want to enable or disable to suit your use of the app.

# <p align="center"> History of ReVanced:

YT Vanced was an app that allowed you to enjoy some features of YT Premium features, including an ad blocker, Picture in Picture, and add features such as Sponsorblock and, since the last update, Return YT Dislikes (RYD). But March 13, 2022 was an unfortunate date, as the Vanced team announced the end of YT Vanced support following a cease-and-desist letter sent by Google. For several weeks, many users wondered how they would be able to continue enjoying its useful features, with Team Vanced adding a little later on Twitter that the app would work for another 2 years before becoming obsolete (today, the app no longer works).

A few days later (March 21, 2022), after announcing the end of the application, ReVanced was hard at work creating the same Vanced functions in order to make them open source, allowing you to apply patches yourself. And that's why Team Vanced had to stop developing Vanced: it's legal to modify an application for personal use, but illegal to share it. that's the mistake Team Vanced made. The ingenuity of its spiritual successor ReVanced, rather than offering applications for free download, not only keeps them legal, but gives us control over which patches to apply.

After much hard work, the first version of ReVanced was released on June 5, 2022. Later, ReVanced offered patches for YT Music.

Later, ReVanced diversified by offering patches for other applications. At present, YT Vanced no longer works and is no longer secure, so it's time to move on: ReVanced is now as complete as Vanced, but compatible with the latest versions of YT, and, as the project is open-source, it's even safer to use than YT Vanced.

# <p align="center"> As for Extended:
Inotia00 was already proposing features to enhance Vanced ([Vanced Extended](https://t.me/vanced_mod_archive)), and offering applications on Telegram.
After the Vanced Team stopped development, and ReVanced appeared, he edited his code to make it open-source, based on the ReVanced Repository.

Extended offers more comprehensive patches, but focuses solely on YT, YT Music and, more recently, Reddit, offering all Vanced features, plus additional functionality to meet current expectations regarding new YT features. Although its community is smaller than that of ReVanced, Inotia00 has chosen to open a Crowdin for its community to help translate YT Extended and YT Music Extended into their language, so that, as with Vanced, the added settings are translated.

# <p align="center"> So why Anddea exists?
For a while, inotia00 stopped Extended, and Anddea took over until Extended was back in service. But now that inotia00 has temporarily or permanently stopped creating patches submitted by the community, Anddea is responsible for adding patches submitted by the community.
Overall, Extended and ReReX are similar, but ReReX has more features than Extended, even though Extended has quite a few.

I thank [Vanced team](https://github.com/TeamVanced) for creating YT Vanced and Vanced Music, [ReVanced Team](https://github.com/ReVanced) for resurrecting Vanced with YT and YT Music, and diversifying, [Inotia00](https://github.com/inotia00) for enhancing ReVanced by adding very useful functions to YT and YT Music, and Anddea, a potential successor for Extended [Anddea](https://github.com/anddea).

You deserve more recognition.

# <p align="center"> Warning !

Attention: Anddea does NOT share any patched applications, nor does it recommend the use of any app ready-to-use from download sites. I don't recommend it either, as applications downloaded from third-party sites may contain malicious code. The only solution is to use [RV/X Manager](https://github.com/Kevinr99089/Anddea.Builder/blob/main/install.md#for-installing-with-revanced-manager-please-follow-this-tutorial) or [ReVancify](https://github.com/Kevinr99089/Anddea.Builder/blob/main/install.md#for-installing-with-revancify-please-follow-this-tutorial). No site is 100% safe.

# <p align="center"> So why am i using this repository ?

I rather be clear with you: This repository (and similar)  are neither tolerated by Inotia00 for [DMCA](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Millennium_Copyright_Act) reasons. I opened it for personal use. If Anddea see this message: I'd like to apologize for using this kind of solution, it's for simplicity and automation. I can delete this repository if you ask me to, but please note that I do not promote this repository, nor do I use it to share applications or include malicious code.
